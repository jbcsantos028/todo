LisTED is a task management web application developed solely by Joseph Benedict Santos (aka JBS) using Ruby on Rails, Postgres and Bootsrap.

Through the development process, the creator learned the following concepts: one-to-many association, building authentication from scratch (using BCrypt), applying restrictions, and handling exceptions.

Below are the features of LisTED:

1. The user can create her/his account via app's sign up form.
